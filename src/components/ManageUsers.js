/**
 * questions:
 * 1.   what is the best practice to delete part of a collection?
 *      for example at the onClickDeleteUser function the purpose is to delete the
 *      user from the users collection (this is an easy action) in addition to that, we should also delete just the 
 *      exercises from the exercises collection that their username is the same user we want to delete.
 *      i did it as above. is there a better way?
